Somewhere I have a basemap example that failed b/c zoom level.

Now that I have the data sources and scripts on Dropbox, I will try again.

The script is columbia+topo.py and it works.
Both on DAVE and the MINI.

So I'm not sure what the issue was.

Todo:

The final map with rivers+topo.py

basemap means that snake river isn't plotted
the reason is a CRS mismatch

we've been changing all the other data to 'EPSG:3857'.
'EPSG:3857' is "like" WGS84

The river and lake data is EPSG:4326

The state boundary data is EPSG:4269

What about albers?
EPSG:9822



note:  it is possible to change crs for the basemap
I like that!

one of the other entries triggers the zoom warning.

an even bigger problem:
one of the data sets causes the plot to shift to include much more of the US

it's the pend oreille
not the plotting of it, but just getting the dataset!
it must contain some points from elsewhere

maybe we should filter at the very beginning for 
overlay with the boundary of the region

This does lose the part of the Columbia in BC and the Flathead etc.

I don't have the zoom warning any more
