I've been using two files I got from arcgis

https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/4cf66bf1ae124bf59d1144b789529385

I had been thinking that these don't have lakes.
But now I check again and find Flathead Lake!!

Anyway, decided to try to use OpenStreetMap

well, really, this uses QGIS

https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/241814/downloading-polygon-files-like-lake-or-municipal-borders-from-openstreetmap-in

download and open the QGIS application (it's huge)


must dismiss the notification about could not verify
then Privacy & Security > Allow Anyway

mac mini:
Open Sans font installation failed
no such message on DAVE


OSM place search plugin
Go to Plugins in the menu bar > Manage and Install
Find OSM place search in Not installed and click install


Add the plugin in the panel
It is already there
View > Panels 


New empty project


Search for the item you need
Name contains ... Flathead Lake
only appears when pointer is on search term


Add the item as a layer into your map
toolbar underneath search box
Add object in new layer


Can change CSR bottom right
Leave as EPSG:4326 / WGS 84


Export the layer as a new file
option-click the layer name in the browser panel
Export > Save As

change format to ESRI Shapefile
provide a file name
/Users/telliott/Desktop/flathead

it works
Leaves QGIS app icon on Desktop, won't put into Dock
