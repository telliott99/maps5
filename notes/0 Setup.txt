I.  Setup

p3 is an alias I have set to /opt/homebrew/bin/python3

In any convenient directory, e.g. ~/Programming, do:
p3 -m venv maps

I like working on the desktop so from ~/Desktop do
source ~/Programming/maps/bin/activate

then
pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install matplotlib
python -m pip install geopandas

to work from the command line:
python (not p3!)

and then do imports, etc.
